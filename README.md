# NextJS Redux SSR

A simple proof of concept serving the purpose of entirely server-side building the app and populating the store with essential data. It leverages NextJS's dynamic routing capabilities to achieve this goal seamlessly. The application is designed to handle server-side loading for all dynamic pages while also managing client-side navigation effectively with ReduxToolKit managing the state.

## Tech Used:

- NextJS v12  (dynamic routing)
- Redux ToolKit 
- Tailwind CSS  
- Typescript

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
